The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:

- For perls with long double or greater for NVTYPE, there
  is an unavoidable loss of precision in converting to/from
  the PDL_Double values.  This may effect the results of
  calculations.  A warning is output every "use PDL;"


- A bug in the perl Nepbm interface code prevents reading or writing
  image files with whitespace in the filename.


- GLUT readline support in perldl with the -glut option not
  yet implemented for win32.  Work in progress.


- A change in perl-5.14 on how the 'x' operator works affects
  PDL's overload of that operator for matrix multiplication.
  This can affect code using parentheses to group.  An example
  that shows the problem is code like:

     f( ($pdl0 * $pdl1) x $pdl2 )

  which now gives an error.  The fix is to force the element-wise
  operation in parentheses to be treated in scalar context rather
  than list context.  E.g.,

    f( scalar($p0 * $p1) x $p2 );


- The current Ctrl-C logic in the PDL shells (pdl2 and perldl)
  doesn't work the same with the perl's new "safe signals".  A
  workaround to the problem is to set the PERL_SIGNALS environment
  variable to "unsafe".  See sf.net feature request #3308168
  for details and any future status.


- The Perl debugger for perls 5.10.1 through 5.14.x has a 
  "feature" leading to false fails for lvalue subroutines when
  run under the debugger.  If you need to debug such code with
  an affected perl version, the work around is to use an
  intermediate temporary variable assignment as in:

    $piddle->slice('0:10') .= 100;           # original slice code
    ($tmp = $piddle->slice('0:10')) .= 100;  # work around perl -d "feature"


- Multiline q'' constructs are broken in the Devel::REPL versions
  1.003012 and 1.003013 so you'll need to use perldl or avoid
  splitting quoted strings across lines.  A fix is being investigated.


- The demo 3d and 3d2 windows do not close (can not be closed)
  after the demo finishes.  You need to exit the perldl shell
  to have the window close.


- When you close a TriD graphics window with the frame widget
  the whole process exits including the perldl shell.


- Extremely verbose but not particularly helpful text output from
  the configure-build-test process.


- Directory completion in the interactive PDL shells (perldl and pdl2)
  using Term::ReadLine::Perl adds a space after each directory expansion.
  To continue to complete, one must delete the space before typing <TAB>
  again.  The problem has been reported as a Term::ReadLine::Perl bug.


- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the
  PDL-2.017_01 release:
